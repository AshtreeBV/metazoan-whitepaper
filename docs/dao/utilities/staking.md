# Staking (sTOKEN)

**A long-term, passive strategy** for participants (or “stakers”). Requires sTOKEN to stake and earns Rebase rewards. Staking APY is inversely related to the number of staked TOKEN.

The ratio of sTOKEN to TOKEN is always honored on a 1 to 1 basis.

## Rebase Mechanism

Refers to the mechanism where your sTOKEN balance increases automatically every epoch. The increase is brought about by the number of newly minted TOKEN from the proceeds of Dealing and converting POTD to the main TOKEN.

## How to Stake?

In order to stake, users need to lock their main TOKEN in exchange for an equivalent amount of sTOKEN. The user’s sTOKEN balance increases automatically at the end of every epoch (every 12 hours).

## How to Unstake?

To unstake, users burn sTOKEN and receive an equal amount of TOKEN. Unstaking makes the user not eligible for the upcoming rebase reward. A fee will be charged upon unstaking, that fee goes to the treasury and will be used to mint TOKEN supply, or increase Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL).

\[
1 \text{ }TOKEN = 1 \text{ }sTOKEN + x \text{%} Fee
\]

To make it attractive for users to stake tokens, a high APY would be offered.

Paying an intrinsic fee helps the protocol have enough price cushion if unwanted price dumps occur.

Staking benefits the staker by earning additional sTOKEN, the dealer by maintaining price or TOKEN at high levels, and the protocol by increasing its TOKEN supply while keeping each TOKEN backed as well as increasing POL.
