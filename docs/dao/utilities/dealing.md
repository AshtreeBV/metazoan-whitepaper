# Dealing

**A short-term, active strategy** for users (or “dealers”). The dealer pays a discounted price for TOKEN that would be given in a period of n-days. The deal includes a discounted price, the number of TOKEN to be given to the dealer, and the vesting period.

Dealing allows the MetaDhana protocol to acquire its own liquidity in the form of stablecoins and other reserve assets by selling TOKEN at a discount in exchange for these assets.

## How to Deal?

In order to deal, dealers pay assets in advance in exchange for TOKEN to be given out on a later date. The dealers pay a **discounted price** for each TOKEN in exchange for having the tokens vested in n-number of days.

The amount of TOKEN to be received by the dealer is set up front in the deal. So when price of TOKEN goes up, dealers will gain more. However, if the price of TOKEN goes down, dealers may achieve breakeven, since payment upfront was discounted, or lose.
