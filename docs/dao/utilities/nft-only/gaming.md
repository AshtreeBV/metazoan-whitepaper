# Reward Engine (Gaming)

Gaming TOKEN, gTOKEN is another derivative of the main TOKEN that is used to reward players for their achievements, rankings, playing time, (Yes, we reward those players who devote time and play our games), and more!

Unlike sTOKEN, gTOKEN will not be tradeable outside of the MetaDhana ecosystem. However, gTOKEN is honored at a 1:1 ratio with the main TOKEN.

## How to convert gTOKEN to TOKEN?

Converting gTOKEN to TOKEN requires a fee, represented by $\beta$, that is used to increase protocol's liquidity and support the treasury.

\[
1 \text{ }TOKEN = 1 \text{ }gTOKEN + \beta
\]

_The value of $\beta$ is currently being calculated and tested for efficiency. Rest assured that formulas would be available prior to launching the related mechanism_

Additional minted TOKEN from here reinforces the idea behind cooperation within the community. The rewards are guided by an oracle to maintain the protocolâ€™s stability.
