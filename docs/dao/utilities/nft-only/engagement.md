## Converting Engagement Tokens to main TOKEN

In order to monetize said rewards, users will invest an amount relative to their rewards that will be used for the minting and backing of each TOKEN and help increase POL.

Additional minted TOKEN from here reinforces the idea behind cooperation within the community. The rewards are guided by an oracle to maintain the protocolâ€™s stability.
