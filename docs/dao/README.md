# MetaDhana DAO

A DeFI 2.0-inspired project that aims to solve issues of DeFI 1.0 regarding liquidity. MetaDhana DAO aims to increase liquidity like all DeFI projects, and at the same time, increase protocol’s liquidity ownership.

The second goal ensures the stability of the platform’s foundation to allow existing use-cases and future ideas to be incorporated and seamlessly and built on top of a stable foundation, by reducing the risk of early liquidity providers jumping ship to the next shiny project.

## DeFI 2.0

DeFI 2.0 is a new category for DeFI projects that addresses the current constraints of DeFI projects. Notable projects in the DeFi 2.0 space are OlympusDAO, Abracadabra, Tokemak, and Curve.

## DAO Architecture

The general features involve Protocol Controlled Liquidity (PCV), staking, gaming (play-to-earn), and governance that is guided by the Main Token along with its derivatives.

The Main Token is backed by an intrinsic value of Php 1.00 or $0.02, using assets in the [Treasury](treasury.md). The term backed means that token price will never fall below its intrinsic value (price floor of Php 1.00) while its upside potential is unlimited (no price ceiling).

## Protocol Controlled Liquidity (PCV)

In a nutshell, the idea is for the project to acquire funds to support its financial applications, rather than tapping users’ funds by enticing them with liquidity mining rewards.
