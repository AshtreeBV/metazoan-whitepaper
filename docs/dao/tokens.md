# Tokens

The protocol would have the main TOKEN and TOKEN derivatives derived from the main TOKEN. Each TOKEN derivative will have its unique use case and role to fulfill in the DAO. Each use case is only unique to a specific TOKEN and is not interchangeable wit other TOKEN derivatives.

## TOKEN Derivatives

These are tokens that are derived from the protocolâ€™s main TOKEN, honored at a 1:1 ratio with the main TOKEN.

1. [Presale](tokenomics/presale-token.md) Token (pTOKEN)
2. [Staking](utilities/staking.md) Token (sTOKEN)
3. [Play-to-Earn](utilities/nft-only/gaming.md) Token (gTOKEN)
4. [Engagement](utilities/nft-only/engagement.md) Tokens
<!--
   <ul>
   <li>Read-to-Earn Token (rTOKEN)</li>
   <li>Watch-to-Earn Token (wTOKEN)</li>
   <li>Chat-to-Earn Token (cTOKEN)</li>
   </ul>
-->

## Tradeable Token Derivatives (TTD)

These are TOKEN derivatives that have their own market and can be traded with other tokens outside the protocol. An example would be the staking TOKEN (sTOKEN).

## Protocol-Only Token Derivatives (POTD)

TOKEN derivatives that do not have their own market and can only be exchanged for the main TOKEN in a one-way fashion. Examples include gaming, read-, watch-, and chat-to-earn tokens represented by gTOKEN, rTOKEN, wTOKEN, and cTOKEN, respectively.
