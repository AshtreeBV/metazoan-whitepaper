# MetaDhana DAO - Simplified

This section is dedicated to our community that prefers light reading to get a simple overview of the project and its key features. Some features are modified features of <a href="https://www.olympusdao.finance/" target="_blank">Olympus DAO</a> and we do not want to credit-grab.

## Key Features

1. Treasury
2. Token Derivatives
3. Staking
4. Dealing (Bonding)
5. NFT Ways-to-Earn

## Treasury

A vault that ‘backs’ each TOKEN to its Intrinsic Value. New TOKEN will be minted based on the RFV of the treasury assets.

“Risk-Free Value (RFV) is the number of funds the treasury guarantees to use for backing TOKEN.” - Olympus DAO

## Token Derivatives

These are tokens that are derived from the protocol’s main TOKEN, honored at a 1:1 ratio with the main TOKEN.

### Tradeable Token Derivatives (TTD)

These are TOKEN derivatives that have their own market and can be traded with other tokens outside the protocol. An example would be the staking TOKEN (sTOKEN).

### Protocol-Only Token Derivatives (POTD)

TOKEN derivatives that do not have their own market and can only be exchanged for the main TOKEN in a one-way fashion. Examples include gaming and engagement tokens.

## Staking

**A long-term, passive strategy** for participants (or “stakers”). Requires sTOKEN to stake and earns Rebase rewards. Staking APY is inversely related to the number of staked TOKEN.

#### Rebase

Refers to the mechanism where your sTOKEN balance increases automatically. The increase is brought about by the number of newly minted TOKEN from the proceeds of Dealing and converting POTD to the main TOKEN.

##### How to Stake?

In order to stake, users need to lock their main TOKEN in exchange for an equivalent amount of sTOKEN. The user’s sTOKEN balance increases automatically at the end of every epoch.

##### How to Unstake?

To unstake, users burn sTOKEN and receive an equal amount of TOKEN. Unstaking makes the user not eligible for the upcoming rebase reward. A fee will be charged upon unstaking, that fee goes to the treasury and will be used to mint TOKEN supply, or increase Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL).

## Dealing

**A short-term, active strategy** for users (or “dealers”). The dealer pays a discounted price for TOKEN that would be given in a period of n-days. The deal includes a discounted price, the number of TOKEN to be given to the dealer, and the vesting period.

## Game Theory: Prisoner’s Dilemma

The TOKEN to be given to the dealers will be newly minted TOKEN, thus increasing TOKEN supply, which leads to an increase in the rebase rewards given out to ‘stakers’.

The more ‘deals’ made by dealers, the higher the yield that stakers enjoy (APY). The higher the APY the more stakers would stake their TOKEN. The more TOKEN staked means more TOKEN locked. The more TOKEN locked the higher the price of TOKEN goes (i.e. TOKEN can’t be sold, and demand would increase). The higher the price of TOKEN in the market the greater the rewards that dealers enjoy.

This cooperative game is called the Prisoner’s Dilemma in Game Theory. The idea is that if everyone cooperates, everyone would enjoy the greatest gains possible. This idea is popularized by Olympus DAO wherein this model gives the user three courses of action:

1. Staking (+2)
2. Dealing (+1)
3. Selling (-2)

The numbers are represented by the user’s utility (i.e. the total satisfaction received from consuming a good or service, in economics - Investopedia). Thus given two (2) actors or users here are all scenarios that may happen along with its respective utilities.

| User 1 / User 2 |  Stake  |  Deal   |   Sell   |
| :-------------: | :-----: | :-----: | :------: |
|      Stake      | (3, 3)  | (1, 3)  | (-1, 1)  |
|      Deal       | (3, 1)  | (1, 1)  | (-1 ,1)  |
|      Sell       | (1, -1) | (1, -1) | (-3, -3) |

_The actions in the first column belong to User 1, while the action in the first row belong to User 2. The values in each plot represent utilities of (User 1, User 2)._

## NFT Ways-to-Earn

**A medium-term strategy** designed to be less active than Dealing, but more active than Staking, is provided to our NFT holders. These include Play-to-Earn mechanisms that are widely adopted in the crypto-space.

Having an NFT unlocks this strategy mix that ropes in fun and leisure with investment strategies. **It does require an investment but only after you have received your rewards!**

Interacting within the MetaDhana Metaverse rewards users. In order to monetize said rewards, users will invest an amount relative to their rewards that will be used for the minting and backing of each TOKEN and help increase POL.

Additional minted TOKEN from here reinforces the idea behind cooperation within the community. The rewards are guided by an oracle to maintain the protocol’s stability.
