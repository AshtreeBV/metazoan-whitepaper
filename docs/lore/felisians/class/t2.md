# TIER 2: THE CENTURIONS (30%)

Planet Felisiusâ€™ perfect soldiers, Centurions are powerful crowd fighters and excels in the open battlefield. Capable of taking and unleashing damage at the same time, these warriors are inspiring to watch and are known to turn the tides of battle with field maneuvers that will make their ancestors proud. Highly prized as field officers and on-site tacticians, Centurions are your key individuals when things are going south, and you need a one cat wrecking crew.

Highly proficient on all existing armaments available in Felisius and even on other Metazoan planes, they are true weapon masters and are forever students to the martial discipline, making them the perfect middle class officers and very valuable on any standing army.

Yet their true value remains on the field of battle, preferring to fight in the vanguard and vanquish their opponents head-on using armored plates or special battle gears designed to maximize their extensive offensive-defensive capabilities, these champions are true nightmares come true!
