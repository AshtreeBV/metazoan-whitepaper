# Rarity Layers

Aside from the rarity based on the classes or Tiers. There is a separate level of rarity which involves the layers or parts of the NFT.

There are currently 22 Different layers that compromise a single NFT. Some layers are packaged and designed to appear as 1 combination, to avoid NFTs that look a bit off, this adjustment reduced the number of unique NFTs that all layers can produce.

Nevertheless, the total unique combinations are around 200,000,000,000 (Yes! 200 Billion, no typos on the zeros). These ensures that each NFT you'd get with look unique.
