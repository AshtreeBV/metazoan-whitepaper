# Panteraxx

Panteraxx is the largest continent of Felisius, spanning almost half of the planet. It is the home of the Big Cats, the ancient Pantherius race, who vanished mysteriously a few thousand years ago. The Felisians are descendants of Pantherius, inheriting their bloodline and are proud of their fighting prowess. They do not shy away from combat to protect the continent from its enemies.

Dotted with lakes, ponds, and rivers, bodies of water can be found throughout the vast land. Panteraxx has been invaded many times by other races from alien planets, but no one has successfully conquered them because their people fought back fiercely with determination and courage. Peaceful yet war-ready, the Felisians are a proud race and will do what they must to protect their homeland from invaders.

In the center of the continent is a mountain range called Mt. Leo that separates north from south. The land is fertile and is conducive to agriculture. In the north, where the air is sweet, there are vast fields of grain growing, while in the south, which has the same weather, lush green forests cover the otherwise bare land.

The continent has nine major cities, including Ur Apex, Iconic City, Pantera Mountain Fort, Plantersburg, Yed, Litterbox Plains, Tipal-O, Khalix, and Tamariska. These cities are all connected with complex road networks. And a system of highways encircles the entirety of Panteraxx, serving as its open border.

The political structure of Panteraxx is a feudal system, where lords rule smaller territories. These lords, also called daimyos, are vassals to the shogun. They must obey the shogun’s orders or risk punishment for disobedience. The shogun is the ruler of Panteraxx. He has absolute power within the continent, and every other lord must abide by his decisions. But there’s still one power above him in all of Felisius, and that’s the Divine Emperor. The shogun rules from the capital city, Khalix, whose current daimyo is Akagi Ichiro.

The nine major cities of Panteraxx have an advanced network of transportation and communication infrastructures. Curiously, most cities of this continent are built near lakes and bodies of water. And Felisians are fond of building underground infrastructures, which suggests that it might have something to do with their tendency to bury and conceal the odor of foul things.

Iconic City is a large metropolis in the middle of Panteraxx. It used to be the capital, and it has many districts that are all connected by roadways. These districts are separated into areas of focus, such as agriculture, commerce, and the arts. The city has a sophisticated sewer system to collect wastewater for recycling or disposal.

Ur Apex is on the northern coast of Panteraxx, where many fishing boats dock every day. The city has a port that accommodates both civilian and military ships. It is also where much of Panteraxx’s resources are shipped to other continents, making it the most important trading center in Felisius.

Pantera Mountain Fort is on Mt. Leo mountain range, which is at the center of the continent. It is a large military fortress that serves as the headquarters of the Felisian army and contains armories, barracks, training grounds, and other such facilities for the warriors to use.

Plantersburg lay near Lake Planters, which is one of the biggest lakes in Panteraxx. This city is built on an ancient ruin that dates back to the time of the continent’s founders, and it has many secret passageways leading to underground facilities.

Yed is a city closest to Khalix. It has established robust trade relations with the continent’s capital. Yed is the center for agriculture and has a large port that keeps up commerce with other continents.

Litterbox Plains is a savannah located near Lake Grouper, which happens to be the second biggest lake in Panteraxx. This lush prairie is home to a rare species of butterfly called the “litterbox,” whose wings were currency from time immemorial.

Tipal-O is a legendary city built on an ancient ruin that dates back to the era of the great Pantera Rex. It has many secret passageways leading to underground facilities. Of the nine cities, it is the smallest. Yet, it serves as the soul of all Felisius. All three continents have sworn to defend and preserve Tipal-O and its heritage sites.

Khalix is the capital city of Panteraxx that nestles near the borders of the other two continents. The name means “the place where felines gather” and is the location of all meetings between lords and shoguns. The shogun and daimyo have their headquarters here, and there are several government buildings throughout its main streets. It has a massive castle where the shogun resides with his family.

Located by the continental shoreline facing the Eastern Ocean, Tamariska is surrounded by water — between the sea and a lake toward the west. And as usual, the city has many secret passageways leading to underground facilities.

In this curiously feudal society, despite advances in technology, every city is governed by a daimyo. The city’s infrastructure is the responsibility of a mayor who must obey the rules set by the lord and shogun. In addition to these two positions, there are also multiple chiefs in each village.

The continent is also home to a rare plant called the dia, whose properties are similar to cannabis. Its leaves can be smoked or eaten for medicinal purposes. Chief priests of some religious cults in villages would smoke rolled dia leaves, believing that they would receive messages from the gods.

Not that they’re smoking, but the inhabitants of Felisians are generally happy cats.
