# Central Battleground

The Central Battleground is an ovular arena that can accommodate over a hundred thousand spectators from all over Metazoa. It has hangars for the participants and guests to park their spaceships. There are reserved sections for travelers and space tourists where every fight is a sight to behold.

Located on the wandering planet called Alavi Stah Hast, the Central Battleground is the place where spectators come not only for entertainment, but also for recreation and gambling. A bettor could lose an entire fortune here.

The materials used to build the arena are specially designed to withstand the harsh environment of the open space. Meteors and meteorites could crash, and when the battle gets heated, opposing camps would take out their high-tech weapons and start shooting. One of the hardest metals, the felicumium, is used for the floor and the arena’s skeletal structure. Then ten layers of bricks from the clay found only in Cainiaris and mixed with Hyaline support the foundation. It combines Felisian and Cainian technologies, resulting in an indestructible battle arena for gladiators, warriors, and champions from different planets and races.

The Central Battleground is an open arena, as there’s no need to protect the fighters and spectators alike from the sun or rain. There was no sunshine here, although occasionally, it would rain meteorites. Nevertheless, since it’s a battlefield, anyone can watch and be entertained at their own risk.

The upper sections of the arena, to the north, are the ones reserved for guests and space tourists and are, therefore, safe. When the fight gets to the audience, it will not reach the visitors who pay extremely high costs for witnessing the spectacle of the battle sport.

The frontage of the arena is the massive twin felicumium columns, measuring 150 feet tall and 3 meters in diameter, which symbolizes the never-ending battle between two opposing camps. Connected to the imposing columns are the circular modules of bricks and Hyaline. They look like bubbles in a bubble wrap when seen from a distance.

The arena has four openings — one on each side. The front gate between the columns is reserved for the guests and space tourists. Champions use the side gates; the spectators from opposing factions, the back gate. It is also the most violent gate where fighting is no longer an uncommon occurrence.

There was a time when the Feral Syndicators and Omni Alliance were friends. But such friendship did not progress into a grand alliance. It is due to some ancient animosities between the Felisians and the Cainians. Nevertheless, they agreed to build an interplanetary arena where the gladiators, the champions of warring planets and races fight, instead of having the planetary governments fight against one another that could lead to destruction. A full-blown interplanetary war could create a black hole that might swallow the entire Metazoan universe.

They called the Alavi Stah Hast arena the Central Battleground or the Central Battlefield, which depends on who is being asked. The Cainians call it Battleground and the Felisians Battlefield. Once the war between factions or planets is declared, they will send their strongest champions to the interplanetary arena.

Legendary champions of the Feral Syndicators and the Omni Alliance have tested their mettle on the hard floor. Those who win retain their glory and pride. The losers live in shame forever. That’s what the games in this arena are about. They’re not just games. They’re an extension of the faction wars, particularly the New Metazoan War between the Syndicators and the Omnis.
