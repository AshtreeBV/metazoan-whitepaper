# Nimravia

Depending on whose perspective, Nimravia is the second largest continent of Felisius. It could also be the second smallest.

Since Felisius has only three continents, it is safe to say that Nimravia stands in the middle in terms of size but not of location. It spreads through the southern hemisphere toward the planet’s south pole, surrounded by the treacherous Dark Ocean. Its northernmost region is close to Panteraxx and is connected by an undersea subway system.

Nimravia consists of seven territories — they are Civet Desert, Bear Valley, Cheetahlan, Lion’s Territory, White Panther, Domestikati, and Central Nimravia. Its nine major cities are spread through the seven territories — Auden City, Balzac City, Godwin City, Hesse City, Derain City, Wilder City, DeLillo City, Amis City, and Gras City.

Tall mountains, large valleys, and rivers crisscrossing throughout the land, Nimravia is blessed with natural resources and scenic outback. The warm colors of the environment and the cool breeze contribute to the attitude of the Nimravians to life. Farming is not uncommon, and the Felisians are sharing what they have. Anyone can pick something to eat from anyone’s farm or garden.

The tallest mountain that nourishes that valley with its freshwater is Mt. Gandhi. All the mountains of Nimravia are connected to Mt. Gandhi so that people could say there’s only one big mountain on the continent and the rest are its limbs.

Nimravia’s terrain and climate have made its inhabitants prosperous. The major industries are agriculture and technological innovation. They produce more food in the entire Metazoan universe, which made the Felisians prominent traders of food products.

Balzac City in Domestikati is Nimravia’s capital. It is located in the northernmost part of the continent. It only takes less than an hour of travel from Panteraxx to reach Balzac City through the undersea subway. And like the other continents of Felisius, Nimravia also hosts an advanced civilization of Felisians. It has a complex transportation infrastructure that links territories and cities. If Panteraxx and Machairos have cutting-edge military facilities, Nimravia is known for its communication technology.

They do not have the military might of Panteraxx and Machairos, but the Nimravians are super intelligent Felisians, and most of them are Ninjas. Also, they are culturally easy going, love playing in the open fields, dancing, and singing. They’re not interested in wars, but when threatened, they could defend themselves using their hyper-intelligence. They have the technology to intercept all communications in Metazoa and other neighboring galaxies.

In the center of Nimravia’s Cheetahlan plains lies the infamous high security Blakat Prison Facility, a maximum level prison system where Felisian Syndicators are housing Omni prisoners for questioning and information gathering. Rumors of ill treatment abound but recent issues about the 2 factions’ frequent clashes in Felisian grounds have led the Tri-Shoguns to formally request an investigation on the said prison facility upon the APAT’s lingering concerns about missing Omni diplomats.

Like the rest of the Felisians, the Nimravians are passionate about what they believe. They could go as far as sacrificing themselves for their conviction— and that’s justice and freedom. They want to see other races free from the shackles of oppression. This is how they continue to fight for what they see as necessary, wanting to invade the Earth for the unfortunate fate of the animal kind at the hands of the human species.

In Nimravia, science is a way of life. Every decision goes through a scientific process. But the people also appreciate the beauty of colors and art and music and dance and stories. The result is a rich culture and a scientifically literate civilization.

Visiting Nimravia should be on everybody’s bucket list, but today might not be the right time to visit this lovely continent. Well, visiting Felisius, in general, is a risky undertaking because of the brewing conflict between the Feral Syndicators and the Omni Alliance.
