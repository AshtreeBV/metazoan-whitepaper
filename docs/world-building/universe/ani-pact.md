# Ani-Pact Armistice Treaty

The Ani-Pact Armistice Treaty, or APAT, is an agreement signed by all the planetary civilizations of Metazoa. The Felisians initiated the act because they wanted to give up their grip on power in favor of a more democratic system where all the races could exercise their right to elect a representative to represent them in the Metazoan council they planned to create.

All Metazoan races representing the cats, dogs, birds, horses, cattle, crocodiles, etc., in the animal universe have agreed to the treaty and signed the agreement. The Cainians welcomed the development they helped organize: convincing the different planetary governments to sign a peace deal.

However, it was a move by the Cainians to weaken the Felisians. The goal of Cainians was to strengthen their faction that eventually evolved into a formidable organization called the Omni Alliance. Hence, the animosity between the two races -- the Felisians and Cainians -- between the feline race and the canine race.

It was the effort of the Tri-Shoguns and the Divine Emperor to convince the rest of the Felisians to agree on the treaty that they hoped would end all conflicts and wars between races. For the Cainians, however, their leader forced all citizens to vote for signing the treaty. But he did it nicely. Anyone who opposed was free to leave the planet. And no one dared to say anything against it.

However, another power player is working behind the scenes. And that’s the planet Aeviis. Well, the Aeviian Kingdom, which had been a long-time enemy of Felisius. Although Aeviis and Felisius are nine light-years away from each other, they have been at a cold war for a thousand years. That’s because the Felisians believe that the Aeviians deceived them and caused the demise of the Pantherius race, or the race of the big cats, who used to be the original inhabitants of Felisius.

The Aeviians have been working hand in hand with the Cainians to secure the support of their Metazoan allies. And the Felisians feel they’re being underhanded, which is already the case. But because of their principled stance, the Felisians and the Tri-Shoguns still pursued the treaty, believing that it would result in lasting peace.

Through the APAT all the Metazoans had gathered at the historic signing of the document for the first time. Ironically, the location was Alavi Stah Hast, where the Central Battleground was to be built. The treaty signatories did not foresee the new development that would occur in the future: that the battles between races are confined to the arena instead of spreading from one planet to the other, preventing the unnecessary annihilation of other races.

The APAT might not be as perfect as it was ideally intended, but it had become an evolving document for the better of Metazoa. Whenever there’s a brewing conflict between the races, the signatories would refer to the document as their binding agreement to never pursue war at a massive scale.

However, when the two major powers in the Feral Syndicators and the Omni Alliance are at war, it is feared to cascade to the rest of Metazoa. Had it not been because of the APAT, which has become an effective deterrent to wars for some reason, it would have been a galactic war that could potentially wipe out the Metazoan universe.

No matter how stubborn the Feral Syndicators and Omni Alliance are, they still seek to adhere to the APAT.
