# Order of the Felix

The Order of the Felix is a company of legendary Felisian champions. They are a chosen few of the elite cat-warriors from Felisius and their 12 mightiest champions, also known as the Shadow Lords, protect the planet from the internal and external threats to the stability of its imperial government.

Every champion is equipped with battle gears, rare garbs, and unique accessories that distinguish the truly elite from the newcomers.

Led by the Three Heralds, who guide it with grace, humor, and wisdom, the Order of the Felix helps keep Metazoa’s balance of power. Inscribed in an ancient scroll is the adage that’s also a riddle: “One gesticulates his wise counsel to the one who whispers it to the other.”

An ancient order that rises from the ashes every time the stability and power balance of Felisius are threatened, the Order is bannered by 12 Shadow Lords, the legendary champions who resurrect from the shadows as the order fulfills its mission.

The order’s origin can be traced to the years when the Felisians and the Cainians were still on good terms. The incident that triggered its formation was the insurrection that happened hundreds of years ago, otherwise called the Tri-Shogun Rebellion.

The rebellion that occurred was the time when the Tri-Shoguns became too powerful. They united behind a masked Shogun of Panteraxx, who believed that the Divine Emperor unjustly governed Felisius. He accused the Imperial Throne of denying the countryside folks the privileges reserved only to those living in the cities. So, he gathered the masses, who considered him their hero, to revolt against the unjust imperial system.

To save his older brother from the rebels, Felix, a legendary prince, formed the order. He went to the countryside and gathered the commoners with the potential to be great warriors. Those who passed the screening underwent training in the ancient form of martial and military arts. And out of the thousands who trained, only a select few emerged as the champions to join the secret group of the Elite 12, which serves as the core of the Order of the Felix.

When the civil war erupted, eleven countryside champions that the prince organized drove the Tri-Shoguns away from the imperial territory and saved the Divine Emperor. But Felix had to pay the ultimate price as he fell at the hands of the masked Shogun. The elite warriors eventually defeated the Shogun and his fighters and tilted the support of the masses to the Emperor and the preservation of the great Felisian empire. After the Tri-Shogun Rebellion, the Order of the Felix pledged its loyalty to the throne. Nikin is the name of the twelfth member of the new Shadow Lords who joined later.

When the Cainians and the Omni Alliance regard themselves as the enemies of the Felisians and the Feral Syndicators, Felisius has been struggling to keep its internal order. Because although the Feral Syndicators are united, beneath the surface is a rift between the Light Lords and the Tri-Shoguns. There’s also a brewing conflict between the Light Lords and the Divine Emperor. One of the 12 Light Lords is consolidating its grip on power to replace the Emperor.

The Light Lords fight with each other, and the one who emerges triumphant would challenge the Divine Emperor. Although, most of the time, they unite to weaken the imperial power. With the imperial throne challenged by the Light Lords, who covet the authority and power that comes with it, it is no coincidence that the Order of the Felix returned to prominence.

The 12 Shadow Lords of the Order of the Felix have equal power and influence to challenge the Light Lords and protect the Divine Emperor from threats. Therefore, keeping the balance of power in Felisius.

But the power player that the Order of the Felix keeps an eye on is that of the Tri-Shoguns. This faction is composed of the three Shoguns of the three continents of Felisius. Although nominally, the Tri-Shoguns share equal power, reality shows otherwise. It is always the Shogun of Panteraxx, the largest continent, and the most powerful territory, that holds all the cards in the deck. The Tri-Shoguns compete with the Light Lords in challenging the throne of the Divine Emperor, as they’re the first to rebel and seek to overthrow him.

The Shadow Lords work behind the scenes to protect the Divine Emperor and preserve his throne. They hold the Light Lords and the Tri-Shoguns at bay. When Felisius is in danger, or its balance of power tilts to the opponents, the Order of the Felix will always rise. If the Light Lords and Tri-Shoguns are a threat to the throne, the Shadow Lords are their direct equivalent standing by the side of the Divine Emperor.

The Omni Alliance adds to the list of factions that the Shadow Lords must handle. As the story unfolds, no one knows what lies ahead, and another company of shadows lurks in the dark.
