# Three Heralds

“One gesticulates a wise counsel to the one who whispers it to the other,” says the saying, which is a riddle, inscribed in an ancient scroll of Felisius.

The Three Heralds are the ancient legends who have lived through the ages and witnessed the Order of the Felix rising and fading into the shadows. They are Glaub, Piip, and Ginbi, the well-known wise felines and the pride of Felisius, whose fame spans ages and generations across the twelve suns of Metazoa.

Glaub is a blind wise feline who is a doctor of the Metazoan lore, while Piip is the one who invented the sign language of Metazoa. Ginbi is the mysterious whisperer of wise counsel to those who are blinded by their prejudice. It’s a common belief that he can cure stupidity and idiocy with his careless but magical whispers.

Ginbi is the whisperer who cannot hear his own voice. He relies on the paw signs that Piip makes. Glaub articulates the wisdom that he thought comes from Ginbi, which in reality comes from Piip, who heard it from the blind wisecat. Most of the time, though, their interpretation of each other’s wisdom would vary in meaning.

Together, the Three Heralds have guided the Order of the Felix since the group’s early beginnings. They accept and approve applications to join the Order by newbies who are out to prove their worth on the battlefield. Glaub, Piip, and Ginbi would quiz the newcomers and impart them the knowledge and wisdom they have accumulated for years.

The three have been friends since they were kittens. They’re the direct descendants of the Pantherius race, the Big Cats that mysteriously disappeared from Felisius. As survivors of that unexplainable event, they have also witnessed the disappearance of their foreparents, which traumatized them. Piip became unable to speak, Ginbi lost his hearing, and Glaub, who used to be the all-seeing kitten, was denied the light of the star in his life.

Despite their being differently-abled individuals, Glaub, Piip, and Ginbi never wavered from pursuing their passion. They continued to live and train to perfection to become the best version of themselves. They filled their minds with all the knowledge of Metazoan science, philosophy, history, and literature. Each one of them has doctorates in different fields of learning. It is the reason why they’re the most learned of all Felisians.

The Three Heralds counseled the founder of the Order, lending their wisdom and fair judgment on things that matter most to the organization. They’re also the ones who wrote the rules of the Order and influenced the creation of the Felisian constitution and planetary laws.

Because of their uncanny capabilities, races and governments from other planets throughout the twelve suns of Metazoa would hire them as consultants, which they gladly and freely granted. It is their conviction to establish ties and diplomatic relationships with alien races to keep the universal peace.

The wisdom, humor, and knowledge of the Three Heralds helped sustain the Order of the Felix. They also shaped the policies and government of the Felisian empire.
