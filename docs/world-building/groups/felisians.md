# The Felisians

The Felisians are a race of alien beings inhabiting the Metazoan planet called Felisius. They are anthropomorphic, bipedal felines with long tails used to balance when walking or express emotion. They have cat-like faces with ears on the top of their heads and whiskers growing from their upper lip area. They sport sharp teeth and claws, and have lithe bodies with long, powerful legs that allow them to move swiftly. Being nocturnal creatures, they can see in the dark.

A highly intelligent race, the Felisians are capable of solving complex problems and making quick decisions. They are incredibly cunning and can trick their enemies with ease. Although they’re warriors by nature, they choose peace, acknowledging that serenity is the path of the gods who are responsible for giving life to their planet. The continent of Panteraxx, where most Felisians live, is named after their ancient deity.

Felisians are supposed to live a life free of the worries and strife of interplanetary wars, though they have a strong taste for warring with their neighbors. The days are peaceful and beautiful on Felisius, where strangers wave at each other as they walk on the streets.

But not all is perfect on the planet anymore, as traitors from within seek to undermine peace in Felisius; some challenge the Feral Syndicators. Some races joined the Feral Syndicators military to keep the peace between territories and planets in Metazoa. As the Emperor declared, “Felisians should rule to ensure peace and prosperity for all beings that live in Felisia and the entire Metazoan universe.”

Of course, this does not bode well with the Omni Alliance that drives the Feral Syndicators away from the Metagate. The Felisians are a proud warrior race that has retained their independence and fierce military traditions. They refuse to concede defeat by their enemy. The Omni Alliance, an interplanetary empire of law-abiding races, used to establish cordial relations with the Felisians.

Known for their bravery and ferocity on the battlefield, some Felisians work as mercenaries in many armies around Metazoa. The Felisians also have strong ties with interstellar trade, often acting as brokers, traders, or simple merchants. They are also famous for their love of wine and the arts. They strike deals with trading partners on One Metazoa Galactic Centre, using rare commodities as currency. They also have business deals with galactic traders called Jaeca, who physically deliver services to their clientele.

The Divine Emperor governs all races on Felisius with benevolence, fairness, and wisdom. He is a descendant of the original Pantherius race that ruled over the Metazoan universe for thousands of years. The Emperor is believed to be the incarnation of the god of war. He was born with all the knowledge and skills of a trained warrior. Revered as the sacred ruler of Felisius for all eternity, his word is the law, and he can make decisions without consulting anyone else – even those from noble bloodlines or great daimyos. Although, this was usually illusory as a power struggle exists among different groups within the Felisian Empire, particularly the rift between the Shadow Lords, the Light Lords, and the Shoguns.

Most Felisians want to live in peace with neighboring planets. They have their own beliefs and religions, so they do not wish to bring harm to anyone. Some believe that the Divine Emperor is a god who came from another planet a billion light-years away from Felisius, which makes him an outsider. Others worship different gods as well as the Divine Emperor himself. The most popular religion is the Church of Ra, named after the Sun God, who created all life in Metazoa. The Church has long been at odds with a religious cult called ‘Ends.’ The Ends worship Pteorx, the God of Darkness. But in the end, they all agree that their ruler should be respected and obeyed unconditionally. Also, more than a quarter of the Felisian population does not believe in any god.

As a warrior race who loves to fight in battles, the Felisians see war as a sacred duty and responsibility. They believe that by conquering other planets and races, they can stop evil from spreading throughout the universe. Their warrior traditions make them proficient in martial arts; they use handheld weapons, especially swords and daggers. But they also use spears, throwing axes, etc. They trained to fight in different situations like one-on-one duels or even when surrounded by enemies. Some Felisians train themselves in the use of force fields to block enemy attacks.

The Felisians are proficient in hand-to-hand combat, much like ancient warriors from Earth’s ancient Japan. Then add to their martial skills their knowledge about modern technology. They are highly skilled archers and horseback riders, too. Some warriors can even use their spiritual energy to enhance their combat skills.

The Felisians have special techniques that only they knew how to fight in battle without getting hurt or killed. One such technique is called the Crane Step, and it is a way to dodge attacks without getting hit at all. The Leaping Cat is another special move that allows warriors to jump high up in the air, using their tails as springboards, which gives them an advantage over enemies.

The most powerful technique that Felisian warriors can use is called ‘Furiyuku,’ which translates to the power of the Divine Emperor. It allows them to perform physical feats beyond human capabilities. The ability is bestowed upon each member of the royal bloodline handpicked by the Emperor himself. It includes the power to become invisible and to generate energy blasts. It can also create force fields to protect them from enemy attacks. The Furiyuku is considered a great blessing bestowed upon the most powerful of Felisian warriors.

The Felisians are an old race that has developed technology beyond what most races have. They have mastered the art of space travel and exploration, allowing them to reach other planets in Metazoa. Some Felisians are also skilled inventors; they can create spaceships capable of interplanetary flight. They can make cloaking devices that render their ships invisible to enemy vessels.

Felisian technology is advanced enough to create a device that can travel through time and space. The Felisians have also mastered the art of genetic engineering, which allows them to build hybrid beings with unique powers and abilities by combining different species.

Panteraxx is the location of the Feral Syndicators. Hence, it became the leading power of Felisius. They combine military strength and political finesse that takes into consideration all aspects of shadow governance and rule. But the focus of the Syndicators is more of the interplanetary affairs rather than local.

Select races must have representation in the Syndicators to ensure prosperity for everyone living in Felisius and nearby planets. They have a vision of a dawn of a new era: for peace to reign supreme among all Metazoans who would eventually find themselves under one government.
