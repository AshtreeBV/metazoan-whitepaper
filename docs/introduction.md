# The Metazoan Chronicles

## World-Concept

The vastness of virtual space offers limitless possibilities that extend beyond human imagination. It can contain multiple worlds or universes. One of them is Metazoa, a creation of Meta Dhana’s story weavers.

Metazoa is a universe that hosts twelve suns with planets revolving around them. Each solar system has habitable planets, which are homes to different races of alien beings. These alien races fight each other, especially after a group of Metazoan scientists discovers the portal complex within the Helios Zoion solar system.

Metazoan Chronicles kicks off in Felisius, an Earth-like planet that circles the sun named Helios Zoion 350 days a year. The mild climate of its three continents makes it an ideal home to an extraterrestrial race called Felisians. They are cat-like beings possessing higher intelligence with advanced scientific developments, technology, and understanding of the universe.

Panteraxx is the largest continent, covering almost half of the planet. Nimravia and Machairos, the smaller continents, share the rest. Interestingly, these large landmasses share uniform weather — warm during the day and cool at night. The breeze is sweet, and there are different colors all around. It rarely rains on Felisius, and there’s no ice.

Bodies of water dot the planet: oceans, lakes, and rivers. There are also mountains and plains. And most cities are found near the sea, lake, or river. These cities that scatter through the three continents are interconnected through Felisius’ complex transportation infrastructures and road networks.

There will be more planets to be uncovered. But Felisius is the better place to start the exploration of this mysterious universe. The impressive abilities, culture, and economy of its inhabitants would be interesting enough to give us an overview of the different worlds in Metazoa.

Right now, the text-based game lets the player write the story of each chosen character. It’s a generative game where the characters are interactive, and artificial intelligence (AI) recreates the context of the narrative based on the pre-written information about Metazoa.

There are several layers of information that make up the game. These include world-building, character development, sample interaction, and narrative. Then there’s the set rules of the game and the set conditions for moving from one level to the next.

The world-building layer includes information about the planet’s physical description and its inhabitants — history, culture, and political structure. These details corroborate the backstories, personalities, and beliefs of the characters.

The AI crawls these layers of information, arranged into different categories, to generate the setting, narration, and interaction of the story’s characters.

The player performs four actions: ask, act, interact, and tell. These are also layers and sample prompts that the AI can use as a reference in interacting with the player. The player can ask the character questions and carry out actions in the story. Then there’s the dialogue between the in-game or in-story characters. To move the story forward, the player can tell, narrate, and show the details of objects, setting, or next actions to happen.

The grand idea of Metazoan Chronicles involves allowing people to buy real estate on the planets where they can live virtually, transact business, farm, trade, or gamble with other players. It’s a virtual world where anyone can be a tycoon. Each city or territory of Felisius has its own economy.

As the player immerses into the game, there will be opportunities to trade with the Felisians or buy real estate on the planet using its unique currency. It’s an integration of virtual reality and the real world moving forward.
