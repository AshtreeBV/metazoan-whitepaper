# The 12 Shadow Lords

A Shadow Lord is a member of the super elite group of legendary warriors that serve as the core of the Order of the Felix.

As the name implies, Shadow Lords work in the shadows. No one is a recognized leader or face of the order, and from the outside world, not much is known about them. Their prominence lies solely on the name Order of the Felix which is under the guidance of the Three Heralds. They come to the aid of the Felisian empire when at the brink of crisis.

The Shadow Lords are the 12 legendary champions, hailing from the countryside folks from all the three continents of Felisius — Panteraxx, Nimravia, and Machairos. Four elite fighters would represent every continent. They comprise the inner circle of the Order.

For some strange reason, a Shadow Lord only uses a codename. Musashi, Ieyasu, Nobunaga, or Hanzo are only codenames. But the Shadow Lords are powerful protectors of the Felisian empire, as they are the twelve champions who rise to the paramount of power in all of Metazoa.

Most Shadow Lords are male. Descended from the Big Cats generation that mysteriously disappeared, they are agile warriors, quick, and have the uncanny fighting skills envied in the entire Metazoa.

The formation of the Order of the Felix is a direct response to the crisis that the Tri-Shogun rebellion has triggered. The shoguns of the three continents made a calculated move to unseat the Divine Emperor that resulted in a political debacle that could have turned to a planet-wide civil war. Had it not been because of the Shadow Lords rising to the occasion, millions of Felisian lives would have perished.

A civil war erupted as the Tri-Shoguns and the Light Lords competed to oust the Emperor. But little did they know about the Shadow Lords. When the Tri-Shoguns and their armies attacked the Imperial Palace, they were easily dismissed by the eleven champions. The Shadow Lords then defeated the Light Lords in a battle that lasted for nine days. It was called the Nine-Day War of the Lords.

The Empire survived a civil war, thanks largely to the eleven elite warriors who pledged their loyalty to the throne. They renamed themselves the Order of the Felix, attaching the name of the prince to their codenames. Every time the Order of the Felix rises, the warrior who uses the given codename retains its ownership. No matter how many times he reincarnates, he remains the same. The only thing that changes is the level of difficulty they have undergone at the specific periods in the history of Felisius.

The person behind the creation of the Shadow Lords is the Divine Emperor’s brother. His name is Felix. He visited the three continents and toured every territory to recruit fearless and disciplined warriors from the countryside. He gathered the ordinary folks from different regions, and then he selected those he had seen some potential to be guardians of the Empire. There was a strict screening process they set in place for those who like to become members of the order. At the end of the long process, only eleven have successfully passed the test.

But why are there twelve Shadow Lords? The twelfth member is and always has been Felix. Nowadays his name is Nikin, an orphan who grew up in the streets of one of Panteraxx’s cities.

The Shadow Lords are equal in power and influence with the Light Lords and the Tri-Shoguns. They are a fierce company of warriors who are ruthless on the battlefield. They are champions in their own right as they have fought in the Central Battleground arena located in one of the continents of the planet named Alavi Stah Hast.

In terms of ranking and authority, the Shadow Lords are several notches above the common lords of Felisius. But they do not participate in the toxic politics that the lords play to get the position of a Light Lord.

It is a common belief in Felisius that the 12 legendary warriors are immortal like the phoenix.
