# Feral Syndicators

The Feral Syndicators are an interplanetary organization that combines military strength and political finesse to ensure the prosperity of their people. They have a vision for a better future — one where peace reigns supreme among all Metazoans, who would eventually find themselves under the rule of just one government.

As to their heritage and identity, they chose Panteraxx, the largest continent of Felisius, as their base of operations to preserve the culture and traditions of the Pantherius race. Panteraxx is named after one of Felisius’ most revered founders: Pantera Rex or The Panther King.

With Panteraxx, Felisius’ largest continent and the planetary capital, as the location of their headquarters, the Feral Syndicators take advantage of the scientific and technological advances of its cities. They made Khalix the base of their operation, where they build space fleets, store weapons, and conduct research to develop powerful technology that will help them win future battles against the Omni Alliance.

The Feral Syndicators are led by The Seven, or The Ring of Seven. Representing each of the seven major alien races of the Metazoan universe, they have unique characteristics and strengths. They align to various regions in Felisius, and they ally with races from other planets to protect their interests.

The Seven are the highest-ranking officials of Feral Syndicators, but they are nowhere to be found. It is said that they only appear when they choose to. Also known as Wielders, they are a select breed of “crowned” warriors endowed with extraordinary strength and power. They can be appointed, but they cannot be voted off from their position or replaced except when challenged using the Rule of Seven, a test of strength and wisdom. A Wielder can only lose once, and a replacement can take over when he is defeated, dies, or resigns. However, if he is killed during combat or assassinated, the leaders and elders from his region may appoint another representative to replace him.

The Felisian Syndicators are a proud race of felines with similarities to humans. They have a strong sense of honor, and they value loyalty above all else. They have a strict code of honor among each other. Felisians may no longer be as powerful as their legendary ancestors as some of the races in Metazoa, but they are brave warriors who will fight to the very end. They are known for their stealth attacks and guerilla warfare tactics.

Because of the Metagate conflict, the Feral Syndicators in Felisia have tense relations with their Omni Alliance counterparts, an interplanetary organization composed of the different races across Metazoa. The Omnis also have their council and set of legendary figures who work in the shadows.

The Feral Syndicators hold that the Omnis are unreasonable and stubborn in their beliefs that allow the abuses of the animal kind at the hands of evil aliens. But the Omnis believe otherwise. They think that the Feral Syndicators have overreached and exceeded beyond the bounds of the intergalactic laws. They hold that the issue is a matter that aliens and animals in the universe must resolve internally. No other alien beings or races must interfere.
