# The 12 Light Lords

A Light Lord is a recognized high-ranking officer of Felisius who climbs up the ladder of the planet’s political system through sheer grit and determination.

Although technically, the Light Lords are under the authority of the Tri-Shoguns, they see themselves as co-equal with the Shoguns and the Imperial Throne. They are extremely popular among the masses since many have come from the commoner class and have worked their way to become Lords.

Being a Light Lord is a competitive position. Lords from different regions and territories covet it and fight for it. They must increase their prominence, influence, and war portfolio to be even considered a candidate. And anyone can be a Light Lord. The final test is to defeat in a battle a sitting Light Lord to replace.

No one must take the Light Lords lightly. They are knights who have risen from the masses. They do not inherit knighthood from their ancestors, but they should earn it through hard work and experience on the battlefield.

Part of the challenge is to join interplanetary battles and prove oneself worthy of the chance to be a candidate for the office of a Light Lord. The final duel must be between a sitting Light Lord and the challenger. Winning this fight is the loftiest dream of many ordinary Lords of Felisius.

A Light Lord must protect the position, and no one has held it for life. Anyone can unseat a Light Lord anytime. And this is why one powerful warlord has created a barrier for the challengers. Anyone who wants to become a Light Lord must challenge a sitting Light Lord to a duel. The duel is held in Nimravia’s Nusali-X Stadium and witnessed by the Felisian masses through a live broadcast by the Soundly Fog, Metazoa’s popular news delivery and events live stream service.

However, the ultimate battle for an aspiring Light Lord happens at Metazoa’s Central Battleground in Alavi Stah Hast, the gladiator arena where only a few fighters come out as true champions.

People can identify the Light Lords by their crowns named after the twelve traits of a Felisian warrior: Courage, Temperance, Benevolence, Splendor, Vigor, Candor, Patience, Brilliance, Justice, Ardor, Rectitude, and Virtue.

They might not be as formidable as the Tri-Shoguns or as authoritative as the Divine Emperor, but they are a force to reckon with politically in Felisius. They hold a vital role in the planet’s balance of power.

Some Light Lords have been in office for decades, and others would last not more than three years. The shortest tenure was that of Rashomon. He was a Light Lord for only a month, and then his guilt for killing a helpless landlord made him resign from office to face justice. Many Felisians hailed him as a principled hero who lived up to his values.

Felisians are known for their passion for justice and honor. But it has always been the cause of internal conflicts and political turmoil within the empire. For the Light Lords, justice means every Felisian must have equal access to the planet’s resources. While everyone fights for justice in Felisius, no Felisian can understand justice fully, let alone define it. But they do treat each other fairly.
