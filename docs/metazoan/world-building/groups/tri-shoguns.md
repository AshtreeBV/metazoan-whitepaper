# Tri-Shoguns

The Tri-Shoguns are the titular Archlords of the three continents of Felisius. Though there have been countless Shoguns before them, the three Shoguns forever etched their names in the annals of Metazoan history: Le Quiz ‘Art of Panteraxx, Ning Moo of Nimravia, and Sebi Akira of Machairos. They ruled Felisius and exercised influence over the neighboring planets about five thousand years ago.

Today, the Tri-Shoguns are known as influential power players, but they have been subtle about it as their rise to power was predicated by the demise of the ancient communal leadership circle. After the legendary kings of Felisius, the Pantherius race inexplicably ceded their claim to the Metazoic Throne and mysteriously vanished.

Without the guidance of the ancient kings, the old system, where elders took turns in governing their villages, the loss of the wise big cats became too much to bear because there were many territories and leaders to deal with. There was no single focal point to look up to for guidance and direction. A drastic change for the system must happen, and the need for new leaders led to the rise of the Archlords and their armies.

Although their accomplishments never fit the New Felisian Age’s history books, they admit that they are no match to the old Felisius’ Golden Empire, the legendary kingdom of kings. Since it’s already a thing of the past, younger generations of Felisian warriors look into it for inspiration.

The Tri-Shogunate has always been handed from one generation to the next within the family. And for some unique reasons, the succeeding shoguns have taken the emblem colors of their forefathers.

Panteraxx has always been Red for their courage. That’s why it’s the Red Shogun Le Quiz ‘Art and his countless wars against alien slave masters flooding the kitten books. Nimravia’s legendary Blue Shogun is Ning Moo. His wisdom rivals the ancient kings and is a frequent subject of university lectures.

The venerable Green Shogun Sebi Akira is a political genius. He’s the only Shogun to have peacefully brokered a peace treaty between Felisia and Cainiaris, the Planet of the Wolves, and their bitterest rivals.

The deeds of the Tri-Shoguns have outlasted their nine lives. Such are their legends. But it would also be hubris for the Chroniclers to fail to mention the tainted Archlords whose sad plights must be mentioned to serve as lessons for the future leaders of Felisius. Among the few anomalies in the succession of the shogunate was the rise of the Dark Shoguns, whose hearts of gold were misled by the most complicated of reasons.

After centuries of war against the neighboring planets within Metazoa, a peace treaty that lasted a millennium was forged. It left the warriors without battles to fight, and the ordinary Felisians without no one to root for or against. So, they fell into a stupor, and sadly for reasons lost to time, they clamored for war and conquest against other star systems.

The Divine Emperor’s decision to keep the peace, made the Felisians turn to their Shoguns, whose hearts are close to the common folk. It triggered the Tri-Shogun Rebellion, which gave rise to the Order of the Felix.

The Light Lords will always support the Tri-Shogunate system as it would always look after their interests in giving power to the common folks. But power is forever intoxicating. Thus, the existence of the Shadow Lords, whose task of maintaining all balance, keeps the balance. But what can a restless cat do when there’s nothing to scratch?

What now for the planet’s triumvirate of power? Will they finally turn against each other as the turmoil of their proud past keeps on banging against the door of limitations? Or, is it finally the time to unite and revive their thirst for conquest?

The looming war between the two prominent factions of Metazoa has diverted the Tri-Shogun’s attention away from local skirmishes toward something big. They have become preoccupied with supporting the campaign of Feral Syndicators and their advocacy for interplanetary justice against the Omni Alliance.
