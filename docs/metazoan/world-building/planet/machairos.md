# Machairos

Machairos is the smallest continent off Felisius’ northern hemisphere. Made up of five territories and ten major cities, it has the size equivalent to that of the Earth’s Australia.

The continent features mountainous terrain toward the central part, but it’s surrounded by waters. It boasts of its long shoreline and pristine beaches, which explains the locations of its cities and trading centers. The central parts, however, are a vast parcel of land and home to Mt. Eco and Mt. Martin. These twin peaks are largely unexplored, and they are cloaked with legends, tales, and mystery.

Machairos is connected to the southern tip of Panteraxx through a twenty-mile bridge named Continental Arc that is also a famous landmark. It has a complex road system connecting all the territories — North Paw, East Paw, West Paw, South Paw, and Central Paw. The same transportation infrastructure links cities and townships throughout the continent.

Its largest city is North Paw’s Otranto, which is also the capital and the center of government in the hemisphere. Otranto is a peaceful city that hosts Machairos’ government offices, and it is where the shogun rules with authority. Other major cities include Desira, Witchabooka, Meowaii, Castle Dior, Prancing Kitty, Midlandia, Greed Valley, Silver Coast, and Red Leaf.

The Shogun is loved by the citizens of Machairos because of his zest for life and compassion. Although there are some factions among the populace that oppose his policies, they remain respectful. Local Daimyos who seek the shogunate are mostly indifferent, waiting for the opportunity to slide into power.

It was the first Shogun who pioneered the exploration of the inner regions of Machairos, as most of its cities are located along the shorelines. But his advocacy of uniting all the inhabitants of the continent masked his desire to seize power from the hands of the traditional elders. It is said that secrets are buried in Machairos, and what happens there must remain in the land. Thus, it’s not surprising to find out its dark history buried in the pages of time, which adds to its mysterious appeal to visitors and tourists.

While Otranto serves as the cultural and political capital of Machairos, West Paw’s Greed Valley fuels its economy. Greed Valley is the center of economic development, scientific progress, and technological innovation. A research facility is built dedicated to the study of the possibility of merging two planets — Felisius and Earth — in one alternate reality. The goal is to let the alien human species and the Felisian race live in peace, harmony, and mutual respect.

Surrounded by a fifty-mile stretch of dunes with the blue ocean at the horizon, Greed Valley also hosts Felisius’ secret military installation where top officials can spy on other planets in Metazoa. It gives the Felisians an advantage over other races. The first Shogun was the one who conceptualized it, but it was only five hundred years after his death that the structure was completed. With the installation at their disposal, the Tri-Shoguns of Felisius unite in their desire to reclaim the old Metazoic Throne that was once sat on by a Felisian.

The Shoguns of Panteraxx and Nimravia frequently visit Machairos. They would spend days and weeks in Greed Valley plotting strategies to defeat the alien race of the Cainians and other members of the Omni Alliance. But the presence of the other Shoguns does not bode well with the local daimyos and territorial lords. They feel like they’re being undermined, although diplomatically they’re upbeat as members of the Feral Syndicators. Most Light Lords are high-ranking officers of the alliance.

While Machairos appears to be a peaceful continent, shadows are lurking in its darker regions.
