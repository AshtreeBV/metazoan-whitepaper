# Metagate

The Metagate is an intergalactic portal complex located in a vast space somewhere between Felisius and Cainiaris of Metazoa’s Helios Zoion solar system. It has a huge control room and a large console with several screens that show both the exterior and interior parts of each portal.

The entire complex, which encompasses the space that could contain three planets, has over a hundred active portals, and it is believed that there are thousands, if not millions, more waiting to be discovered. Their latest discovery is the Metagate 101 that leads to the planet Earth. Each portal has an observatory where prominent scientists from all over Metazoa gather for extraterrestrial research.

When a team of Metazoan scientists discovered the portal that leads to Earth and its neighboring planets, they installed a new observatory dedicated to a new research program.

With their advanced alien technologies, Metazoan scientists can observe humans on Earth. They also monitor Venus, Mars, Nangol, and Jitra. Humans are not aware of their presence in Helios Zoion’s orbit or another solar system. Neither do they know about the existence of parallel universes and alternate history Earths. The goal of Metazoans is to find out the activities of the aliens living on Earth and other planets in the same universe.

When they started focusing on alien activities on Earth, they realized that humans are enslaving and killing animals for consumption and leisure. The finding leads the Felisians to take a vow of rescuing their animal kind from the hands of humans. The Cainians are opposed to the actions of the Felisians, calling them unjust and disruptors of the universal order. The result of what is now called the Metagate Debacle is the ongoing war between the proud and stubborn Feral Syndicators and the strict and equally stubborn Omni Alliance.

Access to the contentious portal means altering the existing order of reality. And it triggers the Omni Alliance to prevent the rebellious Feral Syndicators from even coming near the Metagate complex. The Felisians see this as an affront to their dignity and pride. And denying them entry to the Metagate is absurdly an overreaction. It also further widens the tear in their relations that started to sour thousands of years back.

Although the two opposing factions showed cordiality before the Metagate Debacle, it was never an enduring one and never will be. The die is cast, Alea iacta est. Who will reign supreme to rule all of Metazoa must be the strongest faction to win it all.

The Feral Syndicators summoned their champions to fight against the warriors of the Omni Alliance. But before the grand battle, set at the Central Battlefield in Alavi Stah Hast, a gigantic asteroid that revolves around Helios Zoion, both the Felisians and Cainians must resolve the internal conflicts arising in their respective factions.

Metazoan scientists believe that there are more portals in the Metagate complex that are yet to be found. And they hit the jackpot when they discover the portal that leads to Earth because it has sub-portals that lead to parallel universes. They also found out that the portal’s main entrance from the Earth’s end is in an observatory located in the planet’s new capital city called New Tokyo. The portal transports travelers from Metazoa to Earth in less than two hours. It is powered by a photon core generator that converts the kinetic energy of asteroids into electricity, which is stored in capacitors for later use.

The climax of the interplanetary drama between the Feral Syndicators and Omni Alliance is yet to happen in the Central Battlefield in Alavi Stah Hast, which has a diameter of one kilometer with thousands of asteroids floating around it. Most of the high-profile battles happen here.
