# Play-to-Earn Mechanism (Proposal)

MetaDhana aims to provide a fun, educational, and stable ecosystem in its metaverse. Longevity is the name of the game, and we plan to build a project that aims to thrive in weathering the bull and bear market seasons in the cryptocurrency markets.

We would like to give the community a chance to come up with their own ideas on how to mold the P2E mechanics to their own liking - since they will be the ones to participate, solidify, support, and help to grow this project. Hence the proposal

## Gamified DeFI 2.0 Protocols

In order to achieve such feats, we will utilize DeFI 2.0 protocols’ ideas that aim to solve and optimize the liquidity problem in the current DeFI space. Heavy research is done on successful DeFI 2.0 protocols in the market, and how can we gamify them.

## How does it Work?

In order to have a strong foundation, the protocol aims to increase liquidity and increase ownership of liquidity in the long run, the idea is based on <a href="https://www.olympusdao.finance/" target ="_blank">Olympus DAO</a>.

The $TOKEN to be used in this metaverse would be backed with an equivalent value that would be its floor price, therefore the $TOKEN will have an intrinsic value wherein price would never fall below it. Assets that are used to back the $TOKEN will be stored in the treasury/vault of the protocol

Players will be rewarded in multiple ways, including but not limited to playing time. Rewards from playing will be a derivative of the main $TOKEN that we would call $pTOKEN for the time being.

- $pTOKEN and $TOKEN will have a 1:1 ratio
- In order to claim $TOKEN, players will burn their $pTOKEN and pay an additional fee that is equivalent to the $TOKEN’s intrinsic value
- This fee would automatically go to the protocol’s treasury that ensures all $TOKEN is backed.
- The proposed mechanism will help support the protocol’s liquidity and allow a stable price growth of $TOKEN

**Situation Example**

Assumptions:

1. $TOKEN price = $10
2. $TOKEN intrinsic value is = $0.02

Every time a Player swaps $pTOKEN for $TOKEN, the player needs to pay an additional fee of $0.02f or every $pTOKEN swapped. So the actual value that the player received is $9.98.

**Note that players can earn $pTOKEN by just playing!**
