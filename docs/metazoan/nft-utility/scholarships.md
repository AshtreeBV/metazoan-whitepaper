# Scholarship (Proposal)

We limited the Genesis NFTs to 9,999 but we want to involve and onboard more people in the protocol. Hence, the team will open a scholarship program that will allow Genesis NFT holders to have their own scholars if they want to.

A smart contract will be deployed to handle the scholarship program so scholars and genesis NFT holders can trust the MATH instead of the actual person. This platform will prevent violation of the agreement made by the scholars and the genesis NFT holder.

Below are additional details regarding the specifics of the scholarship program (_values may change on the final paper, to factor in **community suggestions**, and **economic outcomes**_)

- 1 Genesis NFT is allowed to have 10 Scholars
- The cost of Scholar NFTs will be the same, and they will look alike (ERC-1155)
- Scholar NFTs can play the game and earn gTOKEN like the Genesis NFTs (their earning potential is less than the Genesis NFT)
- Payout Ratio will be 50:50 from earnings of Scholar
- Scholar NFTs can be sold on the market, but once sold, the earnings of the new owner will be 100% owned by the new owner
- Generous Genesis NFT holders can make their scholars own their own children NFTs after certain conditions are met. (Play to Own)
- Optional: Team members who own Genesis NFT will start the scholarship program
