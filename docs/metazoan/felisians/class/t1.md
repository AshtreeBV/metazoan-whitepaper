# TIER 1: PRAETORS (9%)

They say warriors are made not born, yet there are those who will challenge that notion. For there exists quite a few exceptions and it seems they really came into the world blades included.

Prodigious on all Metazoan weaponry to ever exist, Felisian Praetors are icons of war that can literally decide an outcome of a battlefield based on what part of engagement they will choose to participate.

Notorious for making destruction their own art form, these monsters are living and breathing weapons capable of doling out an inordinate amount of punishment all by themselves, with or without weapons.

Easily spotted resplendent in their full battle armor or ceremonial warlord kimonos, worn generally for showmanship rather than protection, general belief suggests that these creatures overwhelm their opponents so quickly that there is a real lack of chances to measure their defensive capabilities, raising some questions about their proficiency for resistance. But then some students of martial wisdom will quickly retort that there is no better defense than an all-out offense. After all, how do you quantify weakness when thereâ€™s no one standing to challenge yours?
