# Class

There are four (4) warrior classes that distinguish the 9,999 Felisians. Each class has their own weighted-percentage based on its rarity. The Legionnaires (common) has a 60% chance of appearing while the Rex (highest rarity) only has a 1% drop chance.

Inspired by Japanese warrior society hierarchies and military aesthetics, the main designs for all tiers except the Rex types (which was taken from the Romans).
