# TIER 3: THE LEGIONNAIRES (60%)

The best Felisian mainforce fighters and ground operators, Legionnaires are known for their lightning quick attacks and battlefield efficiency. Composed of young officers and wily veterans, they are lightly armed due to their propensity for solo strike missions and tactical small team raids.

They say a single Legionnaire can hold off an entire platoon which effectively makes them high value operators (and targets too).

Preferring close combat weapons and light battle gears, most Legionnaires hide their faces to conceal their identities due to their highly sensitive missions. Though there are those who have garnered enough notoriety that they donâ€™t bother hiding their faces and furs. Truly rare ones.
